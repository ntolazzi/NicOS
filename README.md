NicOS
=====
NicOS is my own operating system. Or before I overstate something here, it is really my play repository where I learn how to write an operating system. I decided to dive into this topics because I was always fascinated by the inner working of a computer. I'm driven by my urge to understand every little detail of how things work. From pressing the power button to having a nice GUI.
